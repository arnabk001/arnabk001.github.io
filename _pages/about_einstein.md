Hey there! I'm Arnab, a seasoned Machine Learning Engineer and a Master's student at the University of Washington. Passionate about creating a unified artificial general intelligence (AGI) model, I draw inspiration from the intricacies of the human brain, weaving its brilliance into my machine learning endeavors. With a background at the Indian Space Research Organisation, I've honed my skills in both academic and industrial settings. Currently, I am working in multimodal machine learning at the RAIVN lab, under the guidance of Dr. Ranjay Krishna. 

Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities at the intersection of innovation and machine learning â€” because the best projects begin with a simple conversation.
